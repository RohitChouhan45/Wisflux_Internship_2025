# PostgreSQL Practice – Basics + Relationships

This project contains SQL scripts to help you learn and practice PostgreSQL fundamentals along with relational concepts and JOIN queries.

## 📁 Folder Structure

- `create_tables.sql` – Create a basic `students` table  
- `insert_queries.sql` – Insert sample data into `students`  
- `sample_selects.sql` – Run `SELECT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE` on `students`  
- `create_related_tables.sql` – Create `students`, `courses`, and `enrollments` with foreign key relationships  
- `insert_sample_data.sql` – Insert sample data into all three related tables  
- `join_queries.sql` – Practice `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, and `RIGHT JOIN`

## ✅ Topics Covered

### Day 1 (23 June 2025) – PostgreSQL Basics
- Installing PostgreSQL and using pgAdmin  
- Creating a database and simple table  
- Running basic SQL operations:  
  `CREATE`, `INSERT`, `SELECT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`  
- Understanding constraints like `PRIMARY KEY`, `UNIQUE`, `NOT NULL`

### Day 2 (24 June 2025) – Relationships & JOINs
- Creating multiple related tables using foreign keys  
- Building `enrollments` table to link `students` and `courses`  
- Practicing:
  - `INNER JOIN`: common data between two or more tables  
  - `LEFT JOIN`: all data from left table and matched records from right  
  - `RIGHT JOIN`: all data from right table and matched records from left

## 🛠 How to Use

1. Open pgAdmin or any PostgreSQL SQL client.
2. Run the files in order based on your topic of interest.
3. You can mix and extend queries for deeper understanding.
